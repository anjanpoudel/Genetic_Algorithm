# AI_GENETIC_ALGORITHM

In this Program I have implimented the genetic algorithm to determine the optimal weights of a Neural Network. In ths program there are two agents one is a reflex agent(Hard Coded Logic) and other is Neural Agent(powerd by neural network). Both are Batteling with each other.

Aim of this project was to make the Neural Agent win the tournament. I choose Genetic Algorithm to optimize the weight of neural net. After 100000 Genaration optimal weights was genereated.

# TO RUN
 To run this program run the build.bash file.

 # CHALLANGES FACED
 Implimenting new concept for the first time was bost exciting and challanging. Converting Concept to Code was little challange.
